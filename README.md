# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-of-USA
Total U.S. energy consumption has increased, but energy consumption per capita has decreased ,While total annual U.S. energy consumption has trended upward over time and the U.S. population has increased, the amount of energy consumption per capita (per person)
peaked in the late 1970s. Annual per capita energy consumption was relatively flat from the late-1980s through 2000, and generally decreased each year since then. In 2020, U.S. per capita energy consumption dropped to the lowest level since 1965, mainly because of economic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Factors contributing to lower U.S. per capita energy consumption since the 1980s include:

Increases in efficiency of appliances, electrical equipment, 
and building insulation largely resulting from the establishment of 
energy efficiency standards and improved building energy codes	

Increases in the average fuel efficiency of vehicles resulting
 from the establishment of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) 
standards					

Availability of financial incentives for energy efficiency investments					
Increases in utility-scale electricity generation with higher 
efficiency natural gas-fired combined-cycle and combined-heat-and-power 
generators

Reduction in the energy intensive production of metals and other manufacturing
Increases in population in warmer climate regions of the 
country greater than population increases in colder climate regions 
resulting in lower heating energy consumption and lower total 
residential and commercial sector energy use
